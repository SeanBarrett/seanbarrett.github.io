## Education

### DPhil Astrophysics | *University of Oxford* <span class="cv-text-right">(October 2018 &#x2014; Present)</span>

#### Supervised by Julien Devriendt and Adrianne Slyz; expected thesis submission in September 2022

* <span class="cv-text-list-title">Radiation-coupled primordial chemistry in simulations of the first galaxies (Thesis, in prep.): </span> Modified the radiation-hydrodynamics code RAMSES-RT to include a model of (photo)chemistry for the universeʻs primordial gas, in order to self-consistently predict the formation of the first stars in the universe, and then subsequent star formation in metal-enriched gas. This enables prediction of the resultant stellar populations, and therefore spectra, of the oldest dwarf galaxies, as observed by JWST.
* <span class="cv-text-list-title">A learned model to interpret JWST observations of the early universe (Paper, in prep.): </span> Developed a statistical model to infer the intrinsic properties of high-redshift galaxies from their observed spectral-line fluxes, by using machine learning to extract information from a catalogue of simulated galaxies. This allows better measurements than conventional methods (that are calibrated using observations of the local universe instead).

### MSci Physics with Theoretical Physics | *Imperial College London* <span class="cv-text-right">(2014 &#x2014; 2018)</span>
#### 1<sup>st</sup> Class Honours; thesis project supervised by Carlo Contaldi

* <span class="cv-text-list-title">Relativistic effects on the orbit of stars around Sagittarius A* (Thesis): </span> Wrote a program to numerically solve the geodesic equation in a Kerr metric, and used this to predict general relativistic effects on the orbit of the star S2 during its close pass to the Milky Wayʼs central black hole in 2018, and the gravitational lensing of light reaching Earth.
* <span class="cv-text-list-title">Computational Physics: </span> Studied numerical methods for solving ODEs and PDEs, Monte Carlo methods, FFTs. Applied these to physics problems in various projects.

## Research Experience

### NERC Undergraduate Research Placement | *University of Oxford* <span class="cv-text-right">(Summer 2017)</span>
#### Department of Earth Sciences, supervised by Samar Khatiwhala

* Developed and tested an algorithm for sampling probable trajectories of chemical tracer particles in the ocean. Implemented this in a distributed program with MPI for fast calculation across many processes, running on the universityʼs ARCUS cluster.
* Attended a one week course on GPU programming with CUDA, with the intention of reimplementing my algorithm on GPUs for even greater speed. Although not completed during the summer, this work contributed to the ongoing research of Professor Khatiwala and his DPhil student.

### Undergraduate Research (UROP) | *Imperial College London* <span class="cv-text-right">(Summer 2016)</span>
#### Department of Physics, supervised by Peter Török

* Searched for incomplete vector basis for approximately describing electric field in laser beams, to enable fast/cheap measurement of polarisation state. Performed simulations of measurements with shot noise to find accuracy of reconstruction of field compared with a complete basis.

## Teaching

### Teaching Assistant | *University of Oxford* <span class="cv-text-right">(2020 &#x2014; 2021)</span>
#### Department of Physics, course title: *Radiative Processes in Astrophysics*{: style="font-weight: 600"}

* Led tutorials to solve exam-style problems in this masterʻs-level lecture course. Marked studentsʼ problem sheets and past exam papers.

### Instructor | *Turinglab, London* <span class="cv-text-right">(Jan. 2016 &#x2014; Dec. 2017)</span>

* Travelled to clientsʼ houses to teach small groups of children (8-12 years old) introductory programming in JavaScript, Python and Scratch. Tailored lesson content and set homework to suit abilities and interests of students
